# Coffee-Visualization

Gathered data from the International Coffee Organization (ICO) website;
Transformed the pdf data into an excel spreadsheet; Cleaned the tables and decided which information I was going to use for my visualizations;
Used Tableau to create the visualizations.

#All the values used for te visualization are In thousand 60kg bags, according to the original data. (ICO)

# Project 1 - Coffee Production by Country:

- Cleaned the data and gathered the necessary information.
- Utilized the countries and the amount of coffee produced each year (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) to create different visualizations.
- Created a vertical bar graph, a horizontal bar graph, a line graph, and a map to show the data for each year
- Conclusion: Brazil is the country that produced the highest amount of coffee in the four years according to the ICO data, followed by Vietnam. Brazil produced, on average, almost more than 50% of what Vietnam produced.

# Project 2 - Coffee Data - Importing and Exporting Countries:

- Cleaned the data and gathered the necessary information.
- The original data showed all the importing countries, all the exporting countries, and the World coffee consumption. For this visualization, I used the original data to create two separate tables, one for exporting countries and one for importing countries.
- Created bar graphs to show the amount of coffee exported by each country and the amount of coffee imported by each country. Created two world map visualizations that allowed me to clearly see the data spread out and which countries are exporting coffee and which are importing.
- Conclusion: Brazil is the country that exports the highest amount of coffee yearly (avg 22,149). The European Union has the highest importing rate (avg: 40,567), followed by the United States of America (avg: 26,876).

- Cleaned the data and gathered the necessary information.
- The data shows the coffee consumption worldwide by continent. 
- Created bar graphs to visualize the average consumption in each continent in 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20, and 2020/21.
- Conclusion: Europe is the continent that consumes the highest amount of coffee among the 6 continents analyzed with the data.

Market conclusion about the coffee data: Brazil dominates the exporting marketing and the production market, there is no other country that comes close to the same amount of production and exportation that Brazil has.
In general, the countries that have the highest exporting rate have the lowest importing rate, which was expected. 
When analyzing the coffee consumption by continent, the data showed that South America is in 4th place, behind Europe, Asia & Oceania, and North America, which was surprising considering that Brazil is in South America and is the country that has the highest coffee production rate.
Those visualizations are good tools to explore market advantages, create sales and marketing strategies for each country, define which country will be a better place to open a coffee business, for example, and much more.
